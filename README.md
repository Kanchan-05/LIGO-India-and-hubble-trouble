## Introduction ##

We present a study to investigate how LIGO-India would play a critical role in reducing the timeline for constraining Hubble constant through standard sirens with upcoming LSST observating. Our results show that LIGO-India could increase the number of BNS events with observed EM counterparts by a factor of 2â€“7.
